Rules for development
- always check this file to see if anything has changed
- ensure docker compose is running and online
- edit the same files you are tasked to repair
- clean up artifacts and scripts that were used temporarily
- use existing docker environments for testing or running programs
- ensure any dependency changes persist in the docker and requirements.txt envionment
- If possible, avoid building docker containers and simply run existing images with special commands to import requirements while we test and refine this product.
