- Internal POs need to be easily generated
- they must related to a work order
- they are part of the BOM
- The date needs to be auto inserted
- vendors need to be retreived from quickbooks
- POs need to be entered in the database when created for historical record and so they can be referenced later.
- Part name, part number, material should be retreived from a work order as these POs should be able to be generated from the work order page
- Quantity should also be retreived from work orders noting that the quantity changes throughout the manufacturing process due to loss or batches. Work orders should account for and track production process stages and quantities.
- Certification required should be a check box as it's a binary choice.
- The process should be a multi line check box where we can write our requirements for the work.
