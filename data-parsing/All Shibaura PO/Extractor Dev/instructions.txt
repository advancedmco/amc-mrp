Keep your workspace clean and update readme.md with how to use the program after changes you've made. Honor the python venv and venv setup script and alter extractor.py read and exract content from the 6 pdf files in this folder such that your output purchase_orders.csv matches all the values from benchmark.csv. No hard coding outputs, you must adjust the script in such a way to read all relevant data from the PDFs and ignore useless data like *QUOTE, *DELIVERY, DATE. extractor.py is almost there, make adjustments one at a time until you solve the conditions for accurately extracting data from these example files.
